I used the following dataset for EDA: https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb

As somebody with a background in NLP and text analysis, I find textual data to be quite interesting to deal with. Moreoever, the IMDB dataset from Huggingface contains thousands of reviews on different movies. People use different wordings to express their feelings and for a machine to be able to accurately analyze such emotions is a big deal. Hence, I realized working with this dataset would not only be fun but also that we would be able to draw interesting conclusions from them.
